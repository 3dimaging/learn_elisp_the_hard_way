Lesson 1 - First eLisp Programme
================================

This lesson will show you how to execute your first eLisp programme.

* start Emacs 
* go to the scratch buffer by using the menu `Buffers -> \*scratch\*`

--------------------
What You Should Type
--------------------
``(+ 1 2)``

Now put the cursor at the **end**of the experssion - that is to say after the right bracket and type ``Control-j``

-------------------
What You Should See
-------------------
| ``(+ 1 2)``
| ``3``

---------------
What This Means
---------------

What you typed in consists of an expression ``(+ 1 2)`` and a command to Emacs to execute it ``[Control-j]``. Expressions are sometimes called *forms*.

eLisp is a dialect of Lisp - which stands for List Processing. A list is any thing between two brackets ``(`` and ``)``

The programme that was executed consisted of an operator ``+`` and two constants ``1`` and ``2``

The command to Emacs is applied at the point where the cursor is - it evaluates all the eLisp in the window up to that point and prints the output.
