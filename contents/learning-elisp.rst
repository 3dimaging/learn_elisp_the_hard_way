How This Book Teaches eLisp
---------------------------

This book teaches eLisp throught the medium of Emacs. Emacs has a *scratch* window in which arbritary eLisp expressions can be evaluated. Intitial lessons will use the *scratch* window. Later lessons will move on to creating external lisp files and loading them into Emacs to use them.
